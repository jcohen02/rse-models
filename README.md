# rse-models
### A repository for storing information, documentation, ideas, comments and suggestions on the development of standardised models or approaches to the sustainable development of research software.

---

If you have comments on approaches for sustainable research software development or ideas that you'd like to highlight, please [check to see if there is already an issue for your topic](https://github.com/jcohen02/rse-models/issues), and if not, [create a new issue](https://github.com/jcohen02/rse-models/issues/new).

If you have content you'd like to add to the repository to contribute material to the development of ideas around sustainable research software and sustainable research software groups/communities, please submit a pull request.

#### The rse-models repository

This repository has been created by the 5 authors of a short paper submitted to the 9th International Workshop on Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and Experiences (WSSSPE6.1) to gather and get feedback on ideas to develop and refine more formal models for the provision of Research Software Engineering capabilities at research institutions. The paper's authors are: Jeremy Cohen, Imperial College London; Daniel S. Katz, University of Illinois; Michelle Barker, Australian Research Data Commons; Robert Haines, University of Manchester; Neil Chue Hong, University of Edinburgh. 

The aim is to develop a full paper presenting our models and, through this repository, we are inviting collaboration in this process and the development of the subsequent publication.

The final version of the short paper presented at WSSSPE6.1 is available at https://doi.org/10.1109/eScience.2018.00015. A longer pre-print is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04072"
